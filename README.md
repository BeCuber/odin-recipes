# Odin recipes

A short project to test basic HTML skills by offering, in a humorous tone, recipes to earn the favor of Odin:
- Sacred Mead
- Savage Salmon
- Berries

This allowed me to practice:
- Headlines and paragraphs
- Links and images
- Basic HTML structure
- This README.md
- Basic commands in Git and GitHub
- English
